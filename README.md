## Project Scope

The project will focus on the following areas:

# Data Exploration:
There are a wide variety of suspicious activities that go on social media these days. Thus it is important that we study the different types of suspicious activities.

# Secure Data Collection Techniques:
Finding the right balance between monitoring or detecting suspicious activity or threats in Social media and respecting the user's privacy to maintain ethics, data confidentiality and integrity is crucial while dealing with real data.

#  Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Discussing the various preprocessing and/or NLP techniques to produce a robust dataset for detection of suspicious activities on social media.

# Data Mining Techniques to Handle Multimodal Data:
The data obtained from Social Media can be unstructured and varied as it can contain texts, images, videos and more. So we need to find a data mining technique that can help us process and analyze suspicious activity.

# Leveraging Machine Learning Models:
Specific machine learning algorithms have been previously employed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed tools in the previous research in classifying and categorizing security-related content from Twitter. Research will be performed on whether these algorithms be extended beyond their initial implementation on Twitter, and if they can be adapted for use on other social media platforms with minimal modifications.

# Model Security Assurance:
Discussion on techniques producing a secure machine learning detection model which can refrain from tampering or unauthorized modifications from hackers.

# Model Evaluation:
The suspicious social media accounts to be analyzed need to be found correctly without incorrectly grouping non-suspicious accounts as suspicious. Such incorrect classification would mean questioning the integrity of an honest user. Research will be performed on whether the right approach can be found to classify social media accounts into suspicious or non-suspicious without false grouping.
